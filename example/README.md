# Basic tutorial

In this simple tutorial you will learn how to generate .ski files by using PIGS. 

## Creating the input parameter file

The elements for running SKIRT can be divided into five different classes:

- **Simulation properties**

The basic commands for running the simulation
··· Number of launched photons 
··· Simulation mode: Only extinction, secondary emission from dust, etc... (only tested using 'simulationMode':"ExtinctionOnly")
···

- **Photon sources**
- **Medium sources**
- **Instruments**
- **Probes**
